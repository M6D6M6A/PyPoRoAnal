# `Any usage of the PokÃ©Rogue API outside of the official site (pokerogue.net) is forbidden (The only approved external client at the time of writing is admiralbilly's offline version)`

> [!CAUTION]
> This tool works, but since the game devs expcilite say its not allowed to use the API externally, I will not use the tool myself anymore. But I will use [my MOD overlay `JsPoRoMOD`](https://github.com/PokeRogueMOD/JsPoRoMOD), which does not use the API, but the game object in your browser instead. This is harder to do since its not just editing json, but since mods where not mentioned i will go this route. You can still use this tool at your own risk, but I will only try to fix it if it breaks, so create an issue in that case. I will probably not notice this myself because I am trying to implement all account modification features in the overlay instead and have already implemented the most important features I need and want, besides `.json` import / export!
